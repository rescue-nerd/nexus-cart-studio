# NexusCart Migration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the environment variables needed to run the migration script and deploy the updated Firestore rules.

## üîß **Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

### Firebase Client SDK (Required)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
```

### Firebase Admin SDK (Required for Migration)
```env
# Option 1: Using JSON string (recommended)
FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your_project_id","private_key_id":"key_id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx%40your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}

# Option 2: Using individual variables
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

## üîë **Step 2: Get Firebase Credentials**

### For Firebase Client SDK:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Project settings
4. In the "General" tab, scroll to "Your apps"
5. Click "SDK setup and configuration" for your web app
6. Copy the config values to your `.env` file

### For Firebase Admin SDK:
1. In Firebase Console, go to Project settings ‚Üí Service accounts
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. **Option 1**: Copy the entire JSON content as a single line to `FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_JSON`
5. **Option 2**: Extract these values from the JSON:
   - `project_id` ‚Üí `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID`
   - `client_email` ‚Üí `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - `private_key` ‚Üí `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (wrap in quotes)

## üöÄ **Step 3: Run the Migration**

Once your environment variables are set up:

```bash
# Run the migration script
npm run migrate-categories-plans
```

## üîí **Step 4: Deploy Firestore Rules**

```bash
# Deploy the security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üìã **Step 5: Verify the Migration**

After running the migration, you should see:

1. **Plans collection** in Firestore with 3 plans (Basic, Professional, Enterprise)
2. **Categories collection** in Firestore with 4 categories (Handcrafted Art, Traditional Apparel, etc.)
3. **Product counts** updated for each category

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

1. **"Firebase Admin not initialized"**
   - Check that your environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure the private key is properly formatted with quotes
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **"Permission denied"**
   - Make sure your Firebase Admin service account has the necessary permissions
   - Check that your project ID matches between client and admin SDK

3. **"Firebase CLI not found"**
   - Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Login: `firebase login`

### Environment Variable Format:

For the private key, make sure to:
- Wrap the entire key in double quotes
- Include the `\n` characters for line breaks
- Example: `"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"`
